This is a test-app designed to perform basic fs operations (open, read, write, close).
The purpose of this app is to be loaded into the emulator in order to see its behaviour through the kernel logs.

The kernel logs should catch the app's fs basic operations, in the next order:
-> open file 'testFile.txt'
-> write 'Hello, world!' in file
-> close file
-> open file 'testFile.txt'
-> read file ('Hello, world!' should be read)
-> close file


In order to build and run the app on the android emulator, follow the next steps:

1. Build the app by clicking on "Build" > "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" > "Build APK(s)

2. Install the app on the emulator:

adb -s emulator-5553 install path_to_apk

3. Run the app on the emulator:

adb -s emulator-5554 shell am start -n com.example.testapp/.MainActivity


/* e.g. 

adb -s emulator-5553 install /home/luci/Desktop/thesis/tutorials/tutorial1/TestApp/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.pk
adb -s emulator-5554 shell am start -n com.example.testapp/.MainActivity
